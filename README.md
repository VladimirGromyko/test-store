# Test-Store

This mini-project was created as an example of an online store page where you can select a product and add it to your cart.
At the same time, information is generated on the number of purchased commodity items, their cost and the total cost of purchases. Organized by:
1. control of changes in product balances in the warehouse,
2. control of the exchange rate,
3. timer for automatically updating information about warehouse balances.

Technology stack: Vue 3 + Vite gh-pages
